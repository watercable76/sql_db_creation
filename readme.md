# Development Environment

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Tools Used

The text editor I used is Visual Studio Code, as well as GitHub. I downloaded Git and connected the repo  
to my VS Code. This way I can write content while ensuring it works and is visually easier to work with.  

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### The packages downloaded are here
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Install this software to your computer. This will be a version manager used to install node.js.
2. Run 'npm init -y' which will create a package.json file.  
3. Run 'npm install mongodb' to install the MongoDB driver to the package file.  

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Connect to the database
Copy the connection string and save it in an important place (I saved it in a gitignore file for mine).  
Create a 'index.js' file and use the code listed. Replace the connection string and password with the correct ones. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Programming Language
I used node.js for this project. I will include the steps to download the package below.
