# Development Environment

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Tools Used

The text editor I used is Visual Studio Code, as well as GitHub. I downloaded Git and connected the repo  
to my VS Code. This way I can write content while ensuring it works and is visually easier to work with. 

I used C# for my code. I am going to use sqlite and connect with C#.

### The packages downloaded are here
1. [Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp) - Go to this website to start working with C# with VS Code.  
2. Find and install a C# extension.

## Connect to the database
Copy the connection string and save it in an important place (I saved it in a gitignore file for mine).  
Create a 'index.js' file and use the code listed. Replace the connection string and password with the correct ones.

## Programming Language
I used node.js for this project. I will include the steps to download the package below.
