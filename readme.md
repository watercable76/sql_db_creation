# Development Environment

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Tools Used

The text editor I used is Visual Studio Code, as well as GitHub. I downloaded Git and connected the repo  
to my VS Code. This way I can write content while ensuring it works and is visually easier to work with. 

I used C# for my code. I am going to use sqlite and connect with C#.

### The packages downloaded are here
1. [Downloading C# to VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp) - Go to this website to start working with C# with VS Code.  
2. Find and install a C# extension.  


### Starting with C#
1. [C# Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code)  

Running a file:
* Create folder and save it.  
* Run 'dotnet new console' in terminal. Installs packages and project requirements.  
* Run 'dotnet run' to run the project.  
* You will be prompted to install packages that are required the first time you open a C# file. Install this.  

Run through the tutorial from VS Code about C#. Pretty similar to Java or C++.  
Program is the Program.cs file.

## Connect to the database
Copy the connection string and save it in an important place (I saved it in a gitignore file for mine).  
Create a 'index.js' file and use the code listed. Replace the connection string and password with the correct ones.

## Programming Language
I used C# for this. Documentation is above.
